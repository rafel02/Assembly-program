# Assembly-program
Protocol, Instruction set in assembly language

The 8051 microcontroller is programmed in assmbely language.
C program is human understandable. With assmbely register 
level programming is done. This tell number of machine cycle
need for each instruction.

Protcols of UART , I2C, SPI register level program is combination
of C program to change registers. In this project I wrote
driver level program of wire protocol.
